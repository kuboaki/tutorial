# What's REST?

Representational State Transfer (REST) - Meaningless Acronym? Wordplay?

> rest - n. - peace, ease, or refreshment resulting from the insight that the web works

No matter what vendors tell you - no need to "Light Up the Web" - relax - built on
an **open architecture using universal identifiers, formats & protocols and _evolving_ open standards** -
no need to reinvent the wheel and sign-up for single-vendor offerings.
